This is the source code of a reminder made purely using python

The .exe file will firse ask for user to input hour , minute and seconds
and a message.

REMEMBER THAT THE REMINDER IS CONSTRAINED TO 24 HOURS , SO IF YOU TRY TO 
SET A REMINDER FOR TOMORROW , IT WILL GIVE AN ERROR STATING THE TIME HAS 
ALREADY ELAPSED. 

The exe file will go to sleep for the time specified and 
after the sleep is finished a message to your window screen will appear with
the message you entered at the begining.
